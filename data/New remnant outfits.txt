	description "The Ember Waste is the sort of place where only a very foolish captain would travel without some sort of device for replenishing hyperspace fuel. While this risk is non-existent in Remnant ships due to their gills which act like ramscoops, some captains prefer to speed up the process by adding additional capacity. This ramscoop is not particularly powerful, but it allows a ship to explore without fear of getting stranded."
