Stepping inside the door you note a rack of camouflage netting positioned easily at hand. Given what you have learned of their history, it is probably a last ditch preparation in case they needed to hide the entrance from a raid. The lab itself is a microcosm of Remnant development: The structure appears to be some strange semi-organic material, and you can see an eclectic mix of familiar and unfamiliar shapes cluttering the tables. If you had to guess, you would think that this lab was the result of several different families of technology.`

			`	She quickly slides into the chair opposite and pulls out a datapad. "Firstly, it says that humanity has met a race called the 'Quarg' and have started exchanging technology with them. Is this true?" She looks at you intently. You sign affirmatively, and she excitedly continues. "Could you tell me about them? An alien race that actually interacts peacefully with humanity is exciting!"`
			`	After several hours of telling her about visiting Wayfarer and seeing the Quarg it finally dawns on you that it would be easy enough to take her there. You offer to take her and a couple of her colleagues. She eagerly accepts, and tells you they will meet you at your ship in half an hour.`

			`Dawn and her colleagues are thrilled with the trip. While they had each served on Remnant ships exploring the Ember wastes or patrolling their territory, none had ever been more than a handful of jumps away from their own space. Their ships were always cautious to stay far away from human space to avoid leading anyone back.`
			`	Upon arriving at Wayfarer they spend considerable amount of time watching the few Quarg in evidence, however it is easy to see that the real draw of their attention is the ships. You wave your ID across the scanner for the shipyard and take them inside to browse.`

			`	Almost before you are in the main hall a sales manager is at your side, inquiring as to how he can help. You can almost see the credit signs in his eyes and you suspect that scanning your license may have done a quick check of your net worth too.`
			`	You ask a few leading questions about new designs and play the part of a captain with more money than brains, and the manager eagerly directs you to the big hangars near the end that house their biggest and fanciest ships. After it becomes clear that he doesn't have any experience flying them you politely disentangle yourselves from him to look at the ships in peace.`
