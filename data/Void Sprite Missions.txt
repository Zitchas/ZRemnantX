`As the swirls of gas close over the <ship> you wonder idly what brought you back here. This time, there is no apologetic researcher asking you to risk your life for research, or to return eggs from where they were stolen. The last glimpse of the Archon drifting overhead as you descend below the cloud deck provides no answers; For now, it is nothing more than a silent, brooding presence in the skies of Nenia. The silent depths of an alien world fold over you, gradually erasing the rest of the galaxy from sight.`

`	As the <ship> levels off at the designated altitude, you strap yourself into the pressure suit. Stepping into the airlock, you lower the shields so you can exit onto the hull. Out on the surface, you admire the misty kaleidescope of colors filtering down through the cloud layers, playing over distant shapes moving in the mists. Before too long several void sprites emerge, weaving and dancing among the clouds. They swirl for a few minutes around your cargo bay doors as if waiting for something then pulse briefly with flickers of light and then drop into the clouds below. The third void sprite flutters around the <ship>, poking at things and sliding over them. You quickly think to turn on your video recorder to catch the scene. The Void Sprite notices your brief movement, and turns towards you with a lunge. As it closes on you, your attention is drawn to what you suspect is its mouth: A zig-zapping crack that peels open like a zipper to reveal an opening that resembles an industrial grinder.`

`	Up close, the Void Sprite is massive: Most of its tentacles are easily as thick as your leg, and move with surprising speed and precision. It moves through the air like a strange kind of fish and you can make out a low vibration you suspect is probably from the air whistling over it as it closes with you. Facing down this rapidly approaching giant, you feel something click in the back of your mind and a wave of terror and paralysis washes over you. In a moment of lucidity moments before the void sprite hits, you recall that your shields are keyed to your equipment: You could activate them to protect yourself from what looks like an attack, and they would extend around you. It probably wouldn't be too healthy for the Void Sprite, though.`

`	Your mind latches onto the idea and you trigger the shields in a rush. The millisecond that follows feels like an eternity: The void sprite is just a few meters away, one tendril reaches out and touches you just as the shield slams into place. You see it strike the tendril and severs it cleanly in the process of re-establishing a sealed barrier. The same instant that the pressure on your mind with the terror and paralysis turns off, as if it was simply a dream. You momentarily star at the immobile void sprite, both frozen in shock over what just happened. Then time reasserts itself and sprite spasms away from the ship with an unearthly crescendo of tones. It plunges down into the clouds, leaving you standing on your hull with the floating severed piece of tendril.`
`	You grab the tendril and store it a sealed container. While the attack spoiled the beautiful moment, at least you have a sample and some recordings that might be of interest to Plume.`

`	Despite the feelings filling your mind, you resolve yourself to face down the void sprite without triggering your shields. Time seems to slow down as the sprite rushes up to you and its leading tentacle reaches out and touches you. As you brace for an impact you realize that the sprite has managed to bring itself to a complete stop and the tentacle has telescoped in on itself slightly. You can see that it is touching you, but you didn't even feel the impact. You and the void sprite stand frozen for a moment, and the mind-numbing terror and paralysis snaps off, replaced by a feeling of weightlessness. Moments later the void sprite pulls back and pulses skyward, spiraling around the <ship> before disappearing into the swirling clouds.`
`	As you re-enter the ship, you notice that your suit is covered in some kind of translucent slime. You scrape off as much as you can into a sealed container, but your pressure suit appears to be permanently stained an iridescent purplish color as a result. You resolve to go find Plume, as he will almost certainly find this interesting.`
