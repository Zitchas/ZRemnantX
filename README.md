# ZRemnantX
Zitchas' plugin for Endless Sky, focused on creating missions and content for the Remnant. This plugin is created with the intention of creating something of sufficient quality to be submitted as a pull request to include in the base game.

# The Remnant
The Remnant were originally a group of humans who fled human space in the early years of the Alpha War, circa 2455. They fled in secret, and intentionally made sure that there was no record of them or their departure. Their fear was that the Alpha's would win, and humanity would be destroyed, and thus they sought to establish new worlds where humanity might survive in hiding. To this end they cut off all contact with human systems, and avoid traveling in systems close to the edge of known human space in order to prevent anyone from being able to follow them home.
