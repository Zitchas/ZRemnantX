	description "Centuries ago, the Remnant built these ships in order to explore the upper atmosphere of nearby gas giants. The Archons took issue with the Remnant's research methods, and the studies were unable to be completed. The remaining gascraft have been gathering dust in storage for centuries while the Remnant waits to see if the anger of the Archons will subside."

	description "One of the strangest and most useful things that the Remnant discovered in the abandoned worlds of the Ember Waste is alien cloaking technology. They designed their scout ships to be able to cloak when needed, in order to explore alien territory without being seen... or to escape in a hurry after stealing something particularly valuable from those aliens."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Starling's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Pelican was built to be an evacuation ship - designed to escape quickly and carry enough people and supplies to establish a new outpost."
	description "Due to the fact that their lives may well depend on it, the Remnant engineers have put every trick they know into increasing this ship's potential lifespan against an invading foe. The result is an extremely fast and durable semi-organic ship that refugees can depend on. While the Remnant have yet to unlock the secrets of Jump Drive technology, they have salvaged enough of them from Korath Raiders that they are standard equipment on Pelicans."

	description "Once they left human space, it became apparent to the Remnant that they would need to build their own shipyards in order to defend themselves if they were discovered by the Alphas or any other unfriendly faction. Using new composite materials that they discovered, they built ships very different from anything seen in human space."

	description "Centuries ago, the Remnant built the gascrafts in order to explore the upper atmosphere of nearby gas giants. Now with renewed vigor and ideas coming into their labs, the remnant engineers have developed the new Penguin based on the old gascraft hull. Unlike the gascraft that was a single purpose research ship, the Penguin is designed as a long range early warning scout: Equally adept at research on gas giants, silently monitoring for enemy movements, or infiltrating enemy territory. Unlike the Starling, the Penguin can't fight, but it is very well equipped to run, disappear, and hide in unusual locations."
