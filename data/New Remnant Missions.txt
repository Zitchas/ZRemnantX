			`As you are walking through the spaceport, a woman comes up to you and introduces herself as an engineer at one of their development labs. She pauses awkwardly before beginning to chant: "As your ship is the only one we have seen in generations that has outfits from human space, we are intrigued by it. Could we take a closer look?"`

"If you could get a couple extra that we could dismantle, this could be very useful to us."`

			`You visit the local shipyard and eventually find the engineer busily repairing a damaged Starling. You inform her that you have brought a pair of "Catalytic Ramscoops" for her to study. She quickly tightens a couple more connectors and jumps down from her perch, waving at an assistant to transfer you the credits you were promised. "Thank you! Our maps of human space are old, and if they are still accurate, you traveled a very long way to bring these to us." her chanting voice echoes off the starling above you with an interesting resonance. `
			`	"Thank you for your help," she says. "If we can unlock the secrets of these scoops, it may help keep our ships safe as they search for a safer refuge." As she picks up the remote control for the small loading truck with the two ramscoops she trills at you over her shoulder. "Oh, my name is Tali. I'll let you know what I find.`

"We have made some new discoveries" he exclaims in a trill. "Some of the samples that we took all those years ago are actually eggs of some kind. So the Archon must view our previous research as  being disruptive to the Void Sprite's life-cycles. `
			`"We have been storing these eggs in a cryogenic stasis tank, so they should still be viable and intact. Well, most of them, anyway." His notes trail off on a mournful tone.`

He takes a breath, concentrates, and speaks a short verse about plumage with a complex chord that sounds at once grandiose and self-depreciating. The best you can make out is "Plume." "We can't pay you for this, but if it does appease the Archon we will be able to resume our studies, and who knows where that could lead?"`

			`Once again you have successfully dodged the Archon to land on Nasqueron. Someone, knowing it was going to be there was both worse and better than the surprise of the first time.`
			`	As <ship> sinks through the cloud layers, you gently activate the repulsors to slow your descent to avoid startling the Void Sprites. After what seems like an eternity, you notice a few nearby sprites descending as well, and you match speeds with them, slowing as you reach the altitude listed in the log. `
			`	Setting the ship on auto-pilot, you head back and suit-up in something that looks more reminiscent of the old deep-sea diving suits than anything carried on a modern ship. Readying the eggs in the cargo hold, you equalize pressure in the main cargo hold to the swirling clouds outside, and open the cargo bay doors. As predicted, at this pressure level, the eggs are almost weightless, and are fairly easy to carry to the door of the ship and release.`	
			`	By the time you finish releasing the eggs back into the clouds, several Void Sprites have converged on your ship and appear to be herding the eggs away from you with gentle buffets of their wings. You take a moment to appreciate the alien beauty of these creatures before closing the hatch and purging the ship with fresh air.`

			`Your return trip to Aventine is just as exciting, dodging the Archon on the way out of the system.`

"We will give them a few weeks, then try sending another ship to monitor them. Hopefully the Archon will be pacified by this. Meet me in the lab just off the Spaceport if you are interested in pursuing this "`

			`Following Plume's directions you find a lab tucked behind the main area of the spaceport, where a short walkway leads into an underground structure. Stepping inside the door you note a rack of camouflage netting positioned easily at hand. Given what you have learned of their history, it is probably a last ditch preparation in case they needed to hide the entrance from a raid. The lab itself is a microcosm of Remnant development: The structure appears to be some strange semi-organic material, and you can see an eclectic mix of familiar and unfamiliar shapes cluttering the tables. If you had to guess, you would think that this lab was the result of several different families of technology.`
			`	Plume and several other Remnant are at the back of the room inspecting a bunch of cocoon-like containers, similar to the ones that carried the last batch of eggs back to Nasqueron. After checking a screen he looks up and seems momentarily startled to see you.`
			`	"Ah, <first>! You are just in time." Plume chants quickly, his hands unconsciously dancing in a quick series of gestures. "These cocoons are ready to be delivered, this time to Slylandro. Could you drop them off like you did before?"`

			`As you approach Slylandro you watch the Archon like a hawk, but this time it doesn't attempt to drive you off with tridents of white energy. Cautiously you make your way to Slylandro and begin your descent.`
			`	As <ship> sinks through the cloud layers, you notice the void sprites seem to be tailing you. A few drop past you with startling speed, only to reappear from below as you approach the designated altitude. At the last minute you remember Plume's request to record them, and hit the switch to activate the recorder for the exterior cameras.`
			`	Setting the ship on auto-pilot, you head back and suit-up in the bulky pressure suit once again. Readying the eggs in the cargo hold, you equalize pressure and open the cargo bay doors. As before, the eggs are already floating as you open the cocoons and gently carry them to the door.`	
			`	Almost as soon as you release the first egg a void sprite is there, brushing against the ship to scoop the egg away into the swirling mists. By the time you return with the next one, another sprite is already waiting at the door, undulating in the eerie light. By the time the last egg is released you can see dozens of the strange creatures swarming around the collection of eggs. It occurs to you that you very few humans have ever seen anything like this. You shut the door as gently as you can, purge the ship with fresh air, and begin the journey back to Aventine.`

			`Back on Aventine, you share the recording of the void sprite's behaviour with Plume. "These Sprites demonstrate considerably more communication than we originally thought. And obviously they must have communicated what you did on Nasqueron. Interesting...." Plume's excited staccato exclamations trail off as he begins to make notes on a datapad he pulls out. You let him go off on his rambling ideas, shaking your head in amusement.`

Looking around, you note that it doesn't seem any less busy than usual, just that fewer people are paying any attention to you.

Eventually you manage to ask for directions using what you have learned, and you arrive at a similar desk in a busy plaza.`

He looks at you curiously for a moment and replies with exaggerated slowness. You thank him and follow his directions to find the office without too many false turns.`

You struggle to string the sentences together, but you successfully manage to hold your own for several minutes before he directs you to place your hand on the scanner. After checking the readout he hands you another datachip as well as a stack of holographic print-outs.
