	description "The Ember Waste is the sort of place where only a very foolish captain would travel without some sort of device for replenishing hyperspace fuel. While this risk is non-existent in Remnant ships due to their 'gills' which are effectively built-in ramscoops, some captains prefer to speed up the process by adding additional capacity. For the rare captain braving the area in non-remnant ships, this ramscoop is not particularly powerful, but it allows a ship to explore without fear of getting stranded."

	description "This software upgrade your scanner suite to provide a wide range of utility scanning, including cargo, outfit, tactical, and asteroid scanning. Given that it is just a software reconfiguration of your on-board targeting software, it doesn't have nearly as good a range as installing an actual scanner outfit, but it'll do in a pinch to meet basic scanning needs. Keep in mind it does use additional power and generates heat."
